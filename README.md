# cairn-web

Cairn — Angular application generated from [angular-starter-web](https://github.com/JoanRoucoux/angular-starter-web) v1.5.0.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install    # installs dependencies and generates the API clients (postinstall)
pnpm start      # dev server on http://localhost:4200
```

Calls to `/api` are proxied to `http://localhost:8080` by the dev proxy ([proxy.conf.json](proxy.conf.json)): adjust the target to your backend.

## Scripts

| Script                   | Description                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm start`             | Dev server (with API proxy)                          |

## Next steps

- Make sure `openapi/openapi.yaml` is your real backend contract (replace the placeholder if needed), then run `pnpm run generate:api`.
- Build your pages in `src/app/features/portfolio/`: one folder per screen, named after its route segment (`list/`, `detail/`, ...), holding the page and everything that serves only it — see "Adding a page to a feature" in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the exact naming recipe.
- Adjust the dev proxy target in [proxy.conf.json](proxy.conf.json).

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the architecture, conventions and testing guidelines inherited from the starter.
